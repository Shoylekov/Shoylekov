👋 Hello! I'm a young software developer passionate about writing code and exploring new technologies every day!

🎓 I graduated from the Professional Technical High School of Varna and am currently studying at SoftUni. I enjoy delving into various programming languages, libraries, and frameworks.

💻 Most of my experience lies in Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Django, Flask, Tensorflow and PyTorch.

🤖 I'm particularly interested in diving deeper into Machine Learning and Deep Learning for AI development.

🔍 I'm open to any job or colaboration opportunities in the software development field to gain new knowledge and experience!
